    "title": "🚀 The Full-Stack \"Swiss Army Knife\" (with a Lead Engineer's Brain)",
    "summary": "<div class=\"professional-bio\"><p class=\"tagline\">7+ years. Zero fluff. Infinite scale.</p><p class=\"intro\">I don't just write code; I build digital engines that don't know how to quit. As a Lead Full-Stack Engineer, I've spent the last decade turning \"impossible\" architectures into high-performance reality. From the invisible magic of backend systems to the \"pixel-perfect\" polish of modern frontends, I bridge the gap between business dreams and technical muscle.</p><h2>🛠️ My Secret Sauce:</h2><div class=\"secret-sauce\"><p><strong>The Big Picture:</strong> I own the entire SDLC. I don't just ship features; I streamline the factory that builds them using CI/CD pipelines and GenAI-powered workflows.</p><p><strong>Data-Driven DNA:</strong> I'm obsessed with observability. If it moves, I track it. I use custom scripting and real-time dashboards to hunt down bugs before they even realize they're bugs.</p><p><strong>UI/UX with an Edge:</strong> I believe a backend is only as good as the interface it feeds. I build modular, intuitive frontends that users actually want to touch.</p><p><strong>Business Mindset:</strong> Tech for tech's sake is a hobby. Tech for growth is a mission. I align every architectural decision with the bottom line.</p></div></div>",
